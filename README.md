# inkball_java
This repository contains a desktop game implementation of Inkball, developed in Java. The objective of the game is to guide an ink-colored ball (Inkball) into its corresponding colored hole while navigating various drawn obstacles and hazards. The project uses Gradle as its build automation tool for streamlined dependency management and execution.

 Features
Classic Gameplay: Faithful implementation of the core line-drawing and path-finding mechanics of Inkball.

Level Management: Supports multiple game levels with increasing difficulty.

Simple Physics: Basic physics simulation for realistic ball movement and collision handling.

Cross-Platform: Easily runnable on any operating system with a Java Development Kit (JDK).
